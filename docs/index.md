# Welcome to O2 suite of Web Services

O2 is the latest generation of image archive, access, processing and visualization open source software.  O2 is evolved from OSSIM, OMAR and many other open source technologies into a set of microservices for cloud-ready deployment in addition to standard hardware set deployments.


## Binary Distribution and Setup

For a quick example on how to configure and setup the new OMAR web services please visit the repo found here [https://github.com/ossimlabs/ossim-vagrant](https://github.com/ossimlabs/ossim-vagrant). The vagrant setup uses salt to provision each web service and is a good example on how to setup a default configuration on a CentOS distribution.
