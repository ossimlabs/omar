# Welcome to OMAR suite of Web Services


## Binary Distribution and Setup

For a quick example on how to configure and setup the new OMAR web services please visit the repo found here [https://github.com/ossimlabs/ossim-vagrant](https://github.com/ossimlabs/ossim-vagrant). The vagrant setup uses salt to provision each web service and is a good example on how to setup a default configuration on a CentOS distribution.
