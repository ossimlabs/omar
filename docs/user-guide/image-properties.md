# Image Properties


## Bands
For multi-banded imagery, the red, green and blue "color guns" can be routed to any band within the image. Please aim responsibly.
## Brightness
Uniformly adjust the brightness value of each pixel.
## Contrast
Uniformly adjust the contrast value of each pixel, making the light pixels lighter and the dark pixels darker.
## Dynamic Range Adjustmet
Adjust the ratio of the brightest to darkest pixel. Have you had your coffee yet, because this is about to get statistical. If you take the brightness value of each pixel and make a histogram (that bell-curve think from school that you always seemed to be on the wrong side of) you'll end up with some kind of overall shape. The DRA setting literally "stretches" or "squishes" that shape. Then all those brighrness values are redistributed which can greatly enhance the overall image.
## Interpolation
Select the method by which unknown pixels are determined from known pixels. Things get complicated during image processing, for example, when enlarging an image. If you end up with more pixels than you started, how do you determine what those new pixels look like? Do you poll the audience, phone a friend or maybe just look at the neighboring pixels?
## Sharpen Mode
Select the kernel size used for sharpening. You can also try squinting really hard to bring things into focus.
