# Welcome to the WFS Service for Docker
WFS Implements the OGC WFS standard. The Web Feature Service (WFS) supports returning feature information indexed into either the imagery tables or the video tables.

View the [WFS Service](../install-guide/wfs-app.md#Installation) install guide for additional information on using the service.
